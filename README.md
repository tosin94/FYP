Efficient task scheduling is an important aspect in any cloud computing environment. It directly affects resource utilization, makespan, and job allocation. In a hierarchical cloud setup, if the scheduling algorithms can perform efficiently, then the cloud environment will be able to provide adequate quality of service. In this project, the opportunistic algorithm alongside other algorithms are combined with other algorithms such as max-min and min-min with the aim of ensuring good resource utilization, makespan, and job allocation in the hierarchy. This hierarchical method is demonstrated using a batch mode vector bin packing simulator implemented in java which allows multiple layers of load balancing. The performance data of the hierarchical load balancing proves that the opportunistic algorithm was a good job distributor and the max-min algorithm remains a very efficient scheduling algorithm for cloud environments regardless of the layer it is used in.
